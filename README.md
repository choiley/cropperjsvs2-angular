# angular-cropperjsv2

This is a demo of basic cropperjsv2 features using angular (currently 11).

Cropperjs v2 utilizes webcomponents which can be easily integrated with angular. 

At the day of this writing there is no official demo for angular and cropperjs web components. 
This repo is an attempt to fill this gap.
